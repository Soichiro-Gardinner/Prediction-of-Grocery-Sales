# Sales Prediction Interpretability Study

This repository focuses on interpreting the predictions of a sales forecasting machine learning model. By employing both SHAP and LIME, two popular model interpretability techniques, we aim to provide insights into the decision-making process of the model.

## Project Overview

In today's data-driven world, while accurate predictions are important, understanding the reasoning behind those predictions is equally crucial. This project uses the `sales_predictions.csv` dataset to train a machine learning model and then employs interpretability techniques to break down the predictions.

## Data Preprocessing and Cleaning

**Key Steps:**

1. **Loading the Data:** We begin by loading the sales data.
2. **Anomaly Handling:** Certain anomalies in the `Item_Fat_Content` are addressed.
3. **Feature Selection:** The `Item_Identifier` and `Item_Outlet_Sales` features are dropped, keeping the rest for training.
4. **Preprocessing Pipeline:** A comprehensive pipeline is established to handle both numerical and categorical variables. This pipeline takes care of missing values and scales or encodes features as necessary.

## Model Development and Training

- **RandomForestRegressor:** This ensemble learning method is used for sales prediction due to its versatility and robustness.
- **Train-Test Split:** Data is split into training and testing sets to ensure that the model's performance is evaluated on unseen data.
- **Model Training:** The preprocessed training data is used to train the RandomForest model.

## Model Interpretability

**Approaches Used:**

- **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations):** It breaks down the prediction for a single instance and provides insights into the impact of different features.
- **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations):** This method offers a local interpretation of model predictions by approximating the model using an interpretable one.

## Visual Interpretations

The visual results of the interpretability techniques are saved as images and can be found in the "Project 1[Revisited]" folder:

## Interpretation Summary


### Mean Absolute SHAP Values:
- **Outlet_Establishment_Year**: The establishment year significantly influences predictions with an impact of ~293.2.
- **Item_MRP**: MRP is the next influential feature with an impact of ~256.96.
- **Item_Weight & Item_Visibility**: Both influence predictions with impacts of ~47.61 and ~34.94, respectively.
- Features like many `Item_Identifier` values have negligible influence.

### SHAP Values for the 5th Instance:
- **Item_Weight**: Decreases the prediction by ~18.42 units.
- **Item_Visibility**: Increases the prediction by ~3.19 units.
- **Item_MRP**: Decreases the prediction substantially by ~199.84 units.
- **Outlet_Establishment_Year**: Reduces the prediction by ~183.8 units.

Most other features have minimal influence on this instance.
