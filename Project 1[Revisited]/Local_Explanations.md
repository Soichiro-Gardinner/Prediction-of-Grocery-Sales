## Part 3 - Local Explanations

Continue working in your model explanation notebook from the previous core assignment. Add a new "Local Explanations" header at the bottom and continue your work:

Select at least 2 example rows/outlets based on the insights gained from your previous core assignments this week.
Explain why you selected the examples that you did.
If you're having trouble thinking of which type of examples to select, try selecting a store that had low sales (one of the lowest values for your target) and one with high sales (the highest values for your target).
For each example, produce:

### Lime Tabular Explanation
