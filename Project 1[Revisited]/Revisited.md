# Project 1 - Revisited

## Introduction

In this project, we revisit the task of predicting supermarket sales using the updated tools in sklearn v1.2. We apply what we've learned to explain how our models make their predictions. The goal is to create a new version of our final project notebook, including explanations of the models, feature importances, and coefficients, as well as serializing the best models for future use.
